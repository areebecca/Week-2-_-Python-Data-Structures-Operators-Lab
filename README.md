## Python Data Structures & Operators Lab
# Objective
The objective of this lab is to demonstrate a fundamental understanding of Python operators and string manipulation techniques. This includes performing mathematical calculations, evaluating logical conditions, manipulating binary data through bitwise operations, and utilizing built-in string methods for data formatting.
# Tools Used
Language: Python 3
Enviroment: Google Colab
Version Control:GitHub
# Step-by-Step Process

1.Arithmetic & Assignment Operations: Initialized variables to perform basic math (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division).Advanced Math: Explored Floor Division (//) to discard decimals, Modulo (%) to find remainders, and Exponentiation (**) for powers.Implemented Assignment Operators (e.g., x += 5) to update variable values efficiently.

2.Comparison & Logical Evaluation: Used comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, etc.) to return Boolean values (True/False).Combined multiple conditions using and, or, and not to control the flow of data evaluation.

3.Bitwise Operations: Tested for the existence of elements within a list using in. String Formatting:Applied methods to change case (upper(), lower()), validate content (isalpha(), isdigit()), and transform strings into lists or joined paths (split(), join()).

# Commands Executed

Category    :Example Commands

Arithmetic  :x + y, a // b, a % b, a ** b

Comparison	:x == y, x != y, x >= y

Logical	    :x < 35 or y > 22, not(x < 35)

Bitwise	    :x & y, x ^ y, x << 2, ~x

Strings	    :name.upper(), name.isalpha(), " ".join(list)

# Key Observations / Lessons Learned

1.Precision Matters: Floor division (//) is essential when integer results are required, whereas standard division (/) always returns a float in Python 3.

2.Efficiency: Bitwise operators are significantly faster for specific low-level tasks like cryptography or memory optimization compared to standard arithmetic.

3.Data Validation: String methods like .isalpha() and .isdigit() are powerful tools for sanitizing user input before processing.

4.Logic Inversion: The not operator is a simple yet effective way to flip Boolean logic, which is useful in complex control flow statements.
